#Dictionary Oriented Programming
### It is a slightly different way of thinking about apps

It seems to me that many apps are really building a record one step at the time, say like a business order. In Python a record can well be represented by a dictionary.  

`{'id'; 13579 , 'fname': 'Kristoffer' , 'lname': 'Legind', 'address': "you'd like to know huh"}`
